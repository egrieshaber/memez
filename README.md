What is Memez?
  Memez is a basic meme generator, that allows the user to create their own meme with a top and bottom text fields and a randomly selected image, taken from a third party API (https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes).

Technologies Used.
  HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, React.js

Purpose.
  This app was generated in order for myself to gather some experience working with React.js.  I've used a react template to start this app, and also followed some direction via Scrimba lessons in order to learn how to build this process.

Stretch Goals.
  For the user to be able to save the memes to their local machine.  Also, for the user to be able to select between different APIs in order to have a wider variety of images.
